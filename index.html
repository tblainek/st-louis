                <h1>The St. Louis Divide</h1>
                <p>by <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/timblaine/'>Tim Blaine</a>
                <br><br>
                In 1877, St. Louis, Missouri separated into two distinct governments: the City and the County. 
                Flash forward to 2020: the County has grown in size, while the City has shrunk to a third of its 
                peak population. 
                <br><br>
                How has this division affected the region? This chart shows how U.S. Census tracts are drawn 
                in the City and County, with the color of each tract representing median income of its residents. 
                This gives us a rough idea of how wealth is distributed in the region, but obscures important information 
                about race. We can use visualizations to get a better understanding.
                <br><br>
                Scroll down for a closer look! At any point, you can hover over a bubble to see data for that tract.

                <h2>How many people live in St. Louis?</h2>
                <p>
                Let's start by comparing how many people live in the City and the County. The size of each 
                bubble represents the total population of that tract.
                <br><br>
                As you can see, the County has more than three times the number of residents than the City. In fact,
                the County is more populous today than the City was at its peak! In 1950, it had 856,796 residents.

                <h2>How much do residents make?</h2>
                <p>
                With this in mind, let's order our color-coded census tracts by median income. The result shows us 
                the distribution of median income for the entire region. Notice how color changes from left to right, 
                with blue tracts further to the left than pink tracts. 
                <br><br>
                <span class="highlighter">Median income tends to be higher in the County</span> than in the City. 
                So, who are the residents of the City?
                </p>
                <!-- <svg id = 'legend' width = '400px' height = '500px'></svg> -->
            </section>

            <section class="step">
                <h2>Who lives in St. Louis?</h2>
                <p></p>
                To answer this question, let's return to our first chart and make a small adjustment. The size of each bubble still 
                represents the number of residents in a tract, but 
                <span class="highlighter">color now represents the racial diversity</span> of those residents. 
                Approximately 30% of all Americans are people of color, so purple bubbles signify tracts that meet or exceed 
                the national average.
                <br><br>
                When we count all of the people of color in the St. Louis region, we learn that they make up a higher proportion of 
                City residents (53%) than County residents (31%). While the City has fewer residents than the County, City residents are more racially 
                diverse than those in the County.
                <br>
                </p>
                <svg id = 'categorylegend2' width = '400px' height = '500px'></svg>
            </section>

            <section class="step">
                <h2>What about Black St. Louisians?</h2>
                <p></p>
                The difference is even more stark when we compare Black communities living the City and the County. 
                <span class="highlighter">Black residents are almost half of the City population</span>, 
                while they make up roughly a quarter of the County population.
                <br><br>
                Again, we set the threshold at the national average. Therefore, purple bubbles indicate tracts where at least 13% of residents 
                identify as Black.
                <br>
                </p>
                <svg id = 'categorylegend3' width = '400px' height = '500px'></svg>
            </section>
            
            <section class="step">
                <p>
                <h2>Do race and income interact?</h2>
                So far, previous charts have shown us that median income is higher in the County and that the City is more racially diverse,
                especially when it comes to the proportion of Black residents. Using the same national threshold for purple (13%), let's 
                examine the relationship between the proportion of Black residents (X) and median income (Y).
                <br><br>
                This plot tells us that the 
                <span class="highlighter">median income decreases as the proportion of Black residents increases</span>. We may also 
                observe the many tracts concentrated on either end of this distribution, further pronouncing this wealth divide.
                <br><br>
                No Census tract in 
                <br>
                </p>
                <svg id = 'categorylegend3' width = '400px' height = '500px'></svg>
            </section>

            <section class="step">
                <p>
                <h2>What about poverty?</h2>
                To further confirm the correlation we just observed, we can visualize the relationship between the proportion of residents at or
                below the national poverty threshold and the proportion of Black residents in a census tract. 
                <br><br>
                Another trend emerges. Areas of St. Louis with a greater proportion of Black residents also tend to have a higher proportion of 
                residents living in poverty.

                <h2>Where do we go from here?</h2>
                <p>
                We've only scratched the surface of this complex issue, but hopefully this overview has piqued your interest.
                As you read this, initiatives are underway to repair racial disparities in the City and County. Policy reform, business incentives,
                and community programs are just a few of the important steps being taken towards a more equitable St. Louis.
