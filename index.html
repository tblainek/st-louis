                <h1>The St. Louis Divide</h1>
                <class=>by <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/timblaine/'>Tim Blaine</a></h2>

                <br><br>
                In 1877, St. Louis, Missouri separated into two distinct governments: the City and the County. 
                Flash forward to 2020: the County has exploded in size, while the City has shrunk to a third of its 
                peak population. 
                <br><br>
                How has this division affected the region? While a chart like the one on the right tells a dramatic
                story of population change, it leaves out details about the people living in the City and the County,
                especially when it comes to race and income.

                <h2>How many people live in St. Louis?</h2>
                <p>
                Let's start by elaborating on how many people live in the City and the County. Each bubble represents a 
                U.S. Census tract, which is a standard subdivision of a county. The size of a bubble represents the 
                total population of that tract.
                <br><br>
                As you remember from the previous chart, the County has more than 
                <span class="highlighter">three times the number of residents</span>
                than the City. Hover over a census tract to learn more about the people who live there.

                <br><br><br><br><br><br>
                <h2>How much do residents make?</h2>
                <p>
                With this in mind, let's order our color-coded census tracts by median income. This histogram shows us 
                how median income is distributed across the entire region. Notice how color changes from left to right, 
                with blue tracts further to the left than pink tracts. 
                <br><br>
                <span class="highlighter">Median income tends to be higher in the County</span> than in the City. 
                Now we know that the City is less populous than the County, with lower socioeconomic status.
                So, who are the residents?
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="step">
                <h2>Who lives in St. Louis?</h2>
                <p></p>
                To answer this question, let's return to our first chart and make a small adjustment. The size of each bubble still 
                represents the number of residents in a census tract, but 
                <span class="highlighter">color now represents the racial diversity</span> of those residents. 
                Approximately 30% of all Americans are people of color, so purple bubbles signify tracts that meet or exceed 
                that national average.
                <br><br>
                When we count all of the people of color in the St. Louis region, we learn that they make up a higher proportion of 
                City residents (53%) than County residents (31%). While the City has fewer residents than the County, City residents are more racially 
                diverse than those in the County.
                <br>
                </p>
                <svg id = 'categorylegend2' width = '400px' height = '500px'></svg>
            </section>

            <section class="step">
                <h2>What about Black St. Louisians?</h2>
                <p></p>
                The difference is more pronounced when we compare Black communities living the City and the County. 
                <span class="highlighter">Black residents are almost half of the City population</span> (46%), 
                while they make up roughly a quarter of the County population (24%).
                <br><br>
                Again, we set the threshold to the national average. Therefore, purple bubbles indicate census tracts where at 
                least 13% of residents identify as Black.
                <br>
                </p>
                <svg id = 'categorylegend3' width = '400px' height = '500px'></svg>
            </section>
            
            <section class="step">
                <p>
                <h2>Do race and income interact?</h2>
                So far, we have established that median income is higher in the County and that the City is more racially diverse,
                especially when it comes to the proportion of Black residents. Using the same national threshold (13%), 
                let's examine the relationship between the proportion of Black residents <i>x</i> and median income <i>y</i>.
                <br><br>
                This plot tells us that the 
                <span class="highlighter">median income decreases as the proportion of Black residents increases</span> in the St. Louis
                region. We can also observe many tracts concentrated on either end of this distribution, further highlighting this division in wealth.
                <br>
                </p>
                <svg id = 'categorylegend3' width = '400px' height = '500px'></svg>
            </section>

            <section class="step">
                <p>
                <h2>What about poverty?</h2>
                Finally, we can visualize the relationship between the proportion of residents at or below the national poverty threshold and the proportion of Black residents in a census tract. 
                <br><br>
                As we may expect from the trend in median income, areas of St. Louis with a greater proportion of Black residents also tend to have a higher proportion of 
                residents living in poverty.

                <h2>Where do we go from here?</h2>
                <p>
                We've only scratched the surface of this complex issue, but hopefully this overview has caught your interest.
                As you read this, initiatives are underway to repair racial disparities in the City and County. Policy reform, business incentives,
                and community programs are just a few of the important steps being taken towards a more equitable St. Louis.
